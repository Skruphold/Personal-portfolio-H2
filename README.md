Personal-portfolio-H2
=============

This is my personal portfolio I built from scratch. It displays my name, about me, work section, and a contact section. 
The header includes my name a nav bar that displays some links that you can click on and will jump to corrisponding part of the page.
Then I created an Article class for the picture at the top behind me Coding portfolio title. Link a cool picture too it to make 
it look cooler. After I made my about me section in a main container filled it with some stuff about me and put my personal photo next to it. 
then I closed out that main section and made another article section which i put my works in. I made these flex boxes and put an image with a link
in the first project. When clicked it will bring you too my homework 1. Then I made a footer that has my contact me section and made the email operational when clicked it will open up the persons email to email me. 

I also had to build my css file from scratch, plus a reset css. I tried to make everything a flex box the best I could but trying to configure it with my html gave me issues. I used my 3 favorite colors for everthing and built them to space out correctly. I made my first project picture bigger and its a clickable link. however i have no other work to post in the other sections so I left them blank. The page looks nice on my 32inch screen. Everything fits there, however I really struggled with the media query part and my page does break when you try to adjust size.
